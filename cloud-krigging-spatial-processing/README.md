# VentQ
Ventilation quality monitoring system

RStudio is deployed in the Cloud in order to perform the spatial statistics every time period (established each 5 minutes, with an average function for the CO2 and T/H values captured every 5s).

The R script allows to compute the Kriging map every 5 minutes and take a photo (in png format) in order to sequence a film of the CO2 evolution.
